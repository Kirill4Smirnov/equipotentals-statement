\begin{abstract}
Nowadays electric current in liquids is widely used in industry, for example - in electrolysis and electroosmosis. In this case, it is necessary to predict the current at each point of the liquid. The central question of the research is how voltage is distributed in water continuum and what affects the voltage. Long-known Maxwell's equations are used to development of theoretical model, and the model predictions are verified by experiments. Model predictions can be used in industry to optimize electrolysis process.

\section{Introduction}            %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%            
An electric field arises in the space surrounding an electric charge. The electric field exerts an electric force. The potential at a point in the electric field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the given point. If charge distribution does not change over time, the potential of the points is constant. An equipotential curve is a curve on which the potential is same over the curve. The displacement of a charge over such a curve would require no work.\par

Some studies on the subject have already been done. The basis of the subject is long-known Gauss' law \cite{gauss}, \cite{landavshic}. In "An experiment on equipotential curves"\cite{khaparde} potential around different-shaped electrodes was experimentally explored. Also a formula for the case of cylindrical coaxial electrodes was derived theoretically. The problem of potential produced by static charges on cylindrical coaxial electrodes was explored in "A Simple Electric Field Probe in a Gauss's Law Laboratory"\cite{ludwigsen} and "Electrostatic field plotting apparatus" \cite{smith}. The case of conductive paper as the medium was also considered in "Equipotential Surfaces of Various Charge Configurations" \cite{beyond}.

The automation of line-measurement developed in "High-density electric potential plots" \cite{binder2015high}.

We have researched the subject in condition of two small cylindrical electrodes, placed on opposite sides of measuring area and DC. We used an electrolytic tank with water as conducting medium.


%If two electrodes are placed in a conducting continuum and a voltage is applied to them, equipotential curves arise in the space. The potential of a point can be measured with voltmeter. Several points with the same potential form an equipotential curve. We studied the potentials around two point electrodes placed into an electrolytic tank with water as an electrolyte.

\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For the simplest experimental setup are needed the following materials: container with electrolyte (distilled water), DC power supply with two electrodes and a voltmeter. Put the electrodes in the water, turn on the power and measure voltage with voltmeter. Also a non-conductive checkered sheet can be put in the water to know the coordinates of the point you are measuring. Scheme is in the figure \ref{fig:mesh1}.  \par

For making a significant amount of experiments this method is time consuming, so we robotized the measuring process. We used a biaxical manipulator, that can move the voltmeter probe and write the measure value and coordinates of the probe to a file on a computer. Scheme of the experiment using the manipulator is in the figure \ref{fig:mesh2}. Manipulator characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Work zone: 383 mm x 367 mm
\item Accuracy: 0.1 mm
\item Stepper motors 42BYG
\item MegaPi motor driver
\item Arduino UNO as control board
\end{enumerate}

In both experimental setups we used \textbf{non-conductive container} to eliminate the possibility of current flowing through the walls.\par

It is important to control the substances dissolved in water, so we used distilled water solution with $Na_2SO_4$, because sodium sulfate does not oxidize electrodes, except for sodium chloride, which we used at first. Electrode oxidizing is harmful, because it changes the composition of the water, what can affect the potentials in the electrolyte.\par

As we observed, potentials are not time-independent some time after applying voltage. Voltage difference between electrodes and near electrolyte is increasing from 0 to fixed amount (what causes voltage drop near electrodes), so we waited for 1 minute until the potentials get stabilized. Same effect is observed with the probe, so the probe is needed to move slowly (about 5 mm per second). More about the phenomenon later. \par


\section{Theory}

To describe current in continuum we can use Gauss's law \cite{gauss}, \cite{landavshic} $$\nabla\cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r}$$ which represents the relations between electric field and charge density in any point.\par

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{theory plot.pdf}
    \caption{Voltage plot}
    \label{fig:mesh3}
\end{figure}

We assumed that away from the electrodes water is electrically neutral, what can be verified with electroscope, so from $$\rho = 0 \Rightarrow \nabla \cdot E = 0$$ what is a Laplacian equation, which can be solved knowing boundary conditions. Assuming boundary conditions are -1 V near one electrode and +1 V near the other, we can solve the equation using Wolfram Mathematica. The plot is in the figure \ref{fig:mesh3}. \par

Experimental and theoretical plots are in the figures \ref{fig:mesh4} and \ref{fig:mesh5}. Error of the experiments is about 0.05 V. Measurement of the voltmeter resistance is difficult, because we used Arduino as voltmeter, and it applies a voltage to the sensor pin if the current through the pin is small (about 5 mA). \par

As we can see in the figures \ref{fig:mesh4}, \ref{fig:mesh5}, \ref{fig:dif6} and \ref{fig:dif2}, the theory can quite accurate predict the shape of the equipotentional curves, but gives too big error in prediction a specific potential (the shape of the curves also is consistent with the measurements of paper \cite{binder2015high}). \textbf{The max error is about 80 \% near electrodes.} From surface science we know about the phenomenon named double electric layer \cite{kinetika}, \cite{stillinger}. The phenomenon causes voltage drop near electrodes, so potential in the electrolyte around the electrodes is different from the electrode potential. But the theoretical model works on the assumption that we know potential near the electrodes. We assumed that potential near a electrode approximately equals to the potential on the electrode. But because of the voltage drop it does not. \par

As we observed, if we apply 5V to the electrode, the voltage near it is about 3.5 - 4.0 V and depends on the water salinity. Also, voltage drop depends on the shape of electrodes and time elapsed since applying constant voltage. The effect of voltage drop collapses if the electrolyte gets in motion (perhaps, double layer disintegrates from fluid movement). During the experiments, we waited 1 minute for the voltage drop to stabilize before starting the measurement (AC voltage has not been studied).\par

We measured Electrical Characteristics of different solutions, two plots are in the figure \ref{fig:VACs}. The step of the voltage is 0.5V. Errors are about 0.05V for voltage axis and 5\% for current axis (current was measured in different modes, therefore the accuracy is proportional to measurement value).


In the figure \ref{fig:VACs} is provided solution characteristic, that is ordinary for all studied solutions: in consists of 3 parts, which are provided in the figure \ref{fig:VAC}. The only exception is distilled water, which characteristic is linear.

Characteristic analysis:
\begin{enumerate}   
\item The first piece: according to electric layer explanation, the layers formed by free ions compensate for the potential difference between the electrodes, hence effective potential difference is close to 0, therefore current is close to 0.

\item On this piece is transition to a linear section. The piece can be called "activation", and the "activation voltage" we measured is about 3V.

\item The third piece is a linear dependence. The electric layers are fully formed and no longer change. The solution on this piece can be represented as a series connection of a resistor and a battery, where electric layers are the battery and solution is the resistor. The resistance of the continuum of water depends on the salinity of the solution.
\end{enumerate}

As we observed, "activation voltage" depends on the shape and the nature of the coating of the electrodes. We used a medical needle 1 mm thick.
